    <figcaption> Listening to another Game Developers Conference video like I'm known to do while making these. This speaker is doing a talk on AI artists. I should worry about AI art however I should be a little more worried about AI programing, and then - AI overlords I guess. I think that I may have made a repeat of the character from my first drawing (in the form of a sheep woman).

      Don't mind the gap in comments here. I started to heed my own warnings about data tracking and decided to follow my own advice. So as a happy medium from now on I will only comment on my art. I have decided to start this up again because I started to do interesting things with my drawing. Today I was demonstrating to a friend how to do a trace in my app and decided that I liked doing traces quite a bit. I've decided that I will do traces for some more sketches in the future (or at least side by side sketches like I did with the tigers) since I might need to do this to answer some questions about anatomy and other things to do with figure drawing.
