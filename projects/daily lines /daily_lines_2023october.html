  <h1> Every Day a Line </h1>
  
  <h2> In October 2023 </h2>
  
  <p> I started out this mission to do a drawing every day in November 2022, and besides a blip in the summer, I have dutifully kept up with this challenge.I now have a body of work which I can refer to, and an artistic practice to keep up with. Looking forward to seeing what further work in this project will yield</p>

    <figcaption> I started this sketch off with the brush used at the end of the previous sketch. In this case the brush gave me plenty of opportunities for building mid tones using the low opacity on black, which I will experiment with in future works.

    <figcaption> There was an entire under drawing that I threw away for this piece. It is freeing to finally let go of being married to your initial lines, and I think that this innovation pays off in this piece. I also used many more layers than I usually use to get the desired effect. All this innovation comes from listening to a GDC presentation while drawing and setting aside an hour to draw, which is likely the method I will use for participating in this activity from now on.

    <figcaption> The next series of three drawings is out of order. This drawing was made on the 8th, the next was made on the 7th, and the third drawing was made on the 6th. This occurred due to a miss labelling of a drawing that went astray, that I patched around instead of fixing, these three drawings were also created on a different computer than usual (on my macbook in photoshop using an intuos stylus).

    <figcaption> Every drawing app has its quirks. In the case of Google Canvas it was the fact that layers could not be moved, meaning that drawings on the first layer could not take under drawings for colour. In photoshop, this mistake is emulated by drawing over the background image, which occurred in this case, and is why this drawing is so simple.

That leaves me to 1. edit a video 2. cg model an ant and 3. make card back art for a game contest card game. as well as 1+ complete a research paper summary 1++ study for a midterm 1+++ do a coding assignment and 2+ complete an optional lab assignment. I may have signed up for too much work!

    <figcaption> Still practising drawing tigers for Terisa's Kids book script. I will still rely heavily on reference photographs when I actually draw the illustrations. I recently discovered that my drawing application has hue and saturation dials, which is a discovery I have not taken advantage of yet, yet I will be using this discovery to create tonne based shadows in the future. This drawing uses two colour layers instead of my normal one layer (a layer for foreground and another layer for the ground / background) which is an innovation on how I normally work.

    <figcaption> Today I learnt a new method for drawing eyes from a course I am taking. I tried it out on a smaller figure but it does not quite show on a smaller scale. This method involves making an eye shape based on the shape of the eyelids and drawing details of the outer eye lid such as the fold above and bellow the eye. The exercise we did in class used shading, but I have not yet figured out an adequate method for shading using digital paint, which is really holding me back artistically in this medium.

    <figcaption> I still have not landed on the aesthetic qualities of my first red robot from january, and I think in this case the trick might be my tools and methods. I started off the first drawing using the pencil tool in canvas, which is a much smoother tool then the fine liner tool in sketchpad.

    <figcaption> Had a midterm exam today on image composting. I think I did fairly well on it. I Experimented with shading on this drawing, which started out as a happy accident from leaving an appealing white shape on the face of the mouse character. Will try monochrome shading on my future works. It looks quite good on some of the figures in this piece.

    <figcaption> I always get apprehensive before drawing and worry about starting off with quality, but this apprehension always goes away once I start drawing. In
    this case I made some progress by not immediately turning my first line into a part of a figure, making it into a tree instead. This sketch uses 6 layers, including a background layer and, a main colour layer, an outline layer, and a shadow layer. with two more layers for text.

    <figcaption> This is probably my laziest drawing yet. It comes at the end of an entire day of making light sketches for card art I am working on for a project however, so I can be forgiven. (decided to pencil in all of the art for all of the cards I am working on rather than completing cards one at a time). Still waiting for review of the cards.
