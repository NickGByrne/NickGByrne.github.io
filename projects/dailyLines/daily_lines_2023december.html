    <img alt="December 1st 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,01,23.png">
    <figcaption> The start of a new month and the end of a school term. Next semester will be my last semester of my bachelor's degree at SFU.

    <img alt="December 2nd 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,02,23.png">
    <figcaption> Tried my faces first drawing style again with some slight modifications. This time I made the eyes smaller than I did for the previous works, (and hopefully also more realistic). I still have the problem of not doing under drawings when I use this method, which I need to fix. I have found that making and then erasing into my underdrawings seems to work very well for blocking in poses.

    <h3 id = "12,03,2023">December 3rd 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 3rd 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,03,23.png">
    <figcaption> Just saw the movie Napoleon. The horses and rolling hills in this piece are a little bit inspired by the movie and especially the battle of Waterloo just a little bit. The movie really was not very flattering of its title character.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
    <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,04,2023">December 4th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 4th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,04,23.png">
    <figcaption> Saw a choir perform in my neighbourhood today. Got invited to join. I have to study as well but I'll consider it.

    <h3 id = "12,05,2023">December 5th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 5th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,05,23.png">
    <figcaption> I have to build a game by the end of the month. The countdown is on already. The 5th is already deep into the month!

    <h3 id = "12,06,2023">December 6th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 6th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,06,23.png">
    <figcaption> Watched a video on how to draw the head and another on how to draw the body.Apparently I am supposed to draw a box for the head to get the angle correct, and to draw a similar box for the pelvis.
    </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,07,2023">December 7th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 7th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,07,23.png">
    <figcaption> Another live painted drawing. I like the faces in this one, but the piece sort of weirded out my audience.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
    <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,08,2023">December 8th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 8th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,08,23.png">
    <figcaption> Sometimes when I start with figure drawings it turns into a random collection of semi random figures. That was very true of this piece, so I put them in a random setting. I also make the sasquatch pose a lot, which you can see in the girl in the foreground of the drawing.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,09,2023">December 9th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 9th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,09,23.png">
    <figcaption> Had a game of board gaming down waterfront station. Made some new friends.

    <img alt="December 10th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,10,23.png">
    <figcaption> I incorporated a life drawing of my father in this sketch. It is sort of funny because it looks like all of my made up characters are staring at him.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,11,2023">December 11th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 11th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,11,23.png">
    <figcaption> Playing the game hollow knight on the desktop computer. I didn't die to one of the bosses and beat it on the first run... for once.
    </figcaption>

    <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,12,2023">December 12th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 12th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,12,23.png">
    <figcaption> The characters in the background were traced from a set of sketches done as an underlayer. The original sketches were quite good however the transfer did not work particularly well. You will also notice that there are no poles on the bus in this setting.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,13,2023">December 13th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 13th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,13,23.png">
    <figcaption> Another sketch done for an audience. Not quite as high effort as the other audience sketches done on discord. There is a vague reference to hollow knight in the creation of these bug characters.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,14,2023">December 14th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 14th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,14,23.png">
    <figcaption> Not sure why I drew a lizard man but the scales were fun to draw. I originally intended to put them in an alien landscape but it looks like they might be on an ancient version of earth (with the sky colour being blue).
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
    <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,15,2023">December 15th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 15th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,15,23.png">

    <figcaption> Played a game called monochrome incorporated today. We got to chapter two of the game and had to leave it again for another session. I missed the dinners from my original November and December drawings and decided to draw them again.
    </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,17,2023">December 17th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 17th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,17,23.png">
    <figcaption> Made a bit of a breakthrough in shading in this one, even if my figures are not the best. Play tested a game I helped create today at a board game meetup.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
    <figure>
    <h3 id = "12,18,2023">December 18th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 18th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,18,23.png">
    <figcaption> Got a lecture on how to draw shadows from a friend while drawing this sketch. It leads to the blue shadows in the trees but also to the pasty looking highlights on the characters in the foreground. The challenge was to draw the highlights in five strokes.</figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,19,2023">December 19th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 19th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,19,23.png">

    <figcaption> Been doing cold calls for a speakers series event at SFU. trying to get speakers to participate. It is nerve racking to call up companies out of the blue.</figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,21,2023">December 21st 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 21st 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,21,23.png">
    <figcaption> Did a performance as a morris dancer at the roundhouse. My footing was off a little bit but everyone says I did fine. They might be humouring me. </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,22,2023">December 22nd 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 22nd 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,22,23.png">

    <img alt="December 23rd 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,23,23.png">
    <figcaption> Had to use the google canvas to draw this one tonight.My usual application, sketchpad, kept crashing on me. The different brush tools sort of effect my style. </figcaption>
  	</figure>
	
	<figure>
    <h3 id = "12,24,2023">December 24th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 24th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,24,23.png">
    <figcaption> Am away from my google chromebook with its built in stylus and am drawing this one on photoshop on my main laptop. The rest of the sketches this month will be completed using photoshop. </figcaption>

    <img alt="December 25th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,25,23.png">
    <figcaption> This one was made on my phone, which technically makes it a finger painting.  </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,26,2023">December 26th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 26th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,26,23.png">
    <figcaption> This one was not technically a live painting but I still showed it to one of my discord friends online. They said it looked like a zombie, but I was going for something closer to a golum from lord of the rings. </figcaption>

  </figure>
	
	<figure>
    <h3 id = "12,27,2023">December 27th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 27th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,27,23.png">
    <figcaption> Another phone sketch. I had to use the phone because my license ran out on my adobe subscription. I was too frustrated to finish this one, which is a shame because it would have turned out well. </figcaption>

    <h3 id = "12,28,2023">December 28th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 28th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,28,23.png">
    <figcaption> I sort of empathise with this little angry mouse character. Also the mouse is carying a flower, although it is kind of hard to tell from the lack of tones used in making the grass in this sketch. </figcaption>
  </figure>

    <h3 id = "12,29,2023">December 29th 2023</h3>
    <img alt="December 29th 2023" src="img/2023december/dailylines12,29,23.png">
