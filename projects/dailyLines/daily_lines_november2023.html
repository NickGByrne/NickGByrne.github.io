    <figcaption> As I continue with drawing on digital paint programs I get more and more comfortable adding layers. I added a layer just to incorporate the brown background colour in this image!

    <figcaption> One of the clubs I am a part of just tried to test fire a rocket engine at SFU.They ended up scrapping the event due to technical issues, which is probably for the best, but it is still an exciting experience regardless.

    <img alt="November 7th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,07,23.png">
    <figcaption> I tried tracing over my underdrawings but I did not get satisfactory results. The problem comes from not being able to see the lines I am putting down because of the darkness of the under drawing colour. I can fix this by either using light or coloured under drawings, or by lowering the opacity of the under drawing layer before tracing. I also messed up the proportions of one of the figures due to the under drawing lines looking good with off proportions, which I will avoid in the future.

    <figcaption> Some would question the artistic integrity of this doodle. However I would counter that it made me chuckle, so it stays in the collection.

    <figcaption> Not sure if this one is a dinosaur or some sort of alien. This somewhat simple sketch comes due to going to bed early and waking up to draw, which happens fairly frequently, and which is a habit I need to fix.

    <figcaption> Met my friend rocky today. It was good to get together but I talked to him about too much weird stuff. I probably shoudl have left him alone a little bit.

    <img alt="November 13th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,13,23.png">
    <figcaption>  Using blue line underdrawings instead of black line underdrawings seems to work, however there are still issues with the tracing. This comes from following mistakes made in the underdrawing when defining the line of the final line. To fix this I would likely need to work on making a cleaner and more accurate under drawing.

    <img alt="November 15th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,15,23.png">
    <figcaption> This picture was a little bit of a breakthrough for me. It represents a development in my process, which before either took a very long time or else was done very quickly. I completed the initial sketch very quickly and was left with something that was actually satisfying. I was listening to a Game Developers Conference video which still had time on it, and was wondering what to draw next, so I drew the background city. When I still had time, I decided to do do a shadows and highlights layer on the robot. I finally ran out of time when it came to the text, which is not done particularly well.

    <img alt="November 18th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,18,23.png">
    <figcaption>  I find that in doing this exercise that I get more aware of the passage of time. This gets me worried sometimes about the time that I waste. However this is apparently a good thing according to at least one video I watched on stoic philosophy, in which they said that one should be reminded of the eventuality of death in life. Also I am getting somewhat better at not wasting my time.

    <figcaption> Today I was supposed to help a friend play test their game, however I had to cancel in order to study for an exam. I hope to play test their game next week, because it is quite good.

    <figcaption> Trying to study for my second exam for class on Friday. I was only able to really study at the end of the day, which frustrates me. I will have to make up for this tomorrow.

    <img alt="November 21th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,21,23.png">
    <figcaption> Had a drawing class today. and I think that the bit of warmup that I had earlier in the day really shows in this piece. I would also prescribe better results to the use of the pencil tool in the sketchpad app instead of the fine liner (simple circle) tool. The line layering and texture of the pencil tool make a lot of difference, and I think it makes better curved lines than the other options.

    <figcaption> Another piece drawn for an audience. One of the other discord chat members was posting video of the moon and Jupiter through their telescope, so I kept taking breaks from drawing to view their work. Had an exam on image processing today which I think (I hope) went well.

    <figcaption> I am trying to figure out why my faces always turn out so differently every time I draw. I am trying to formalise a technique to produce good results every time I sketch, which has not always been happening.

    <img alt="November 28th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,28,23.png">
    <figcaption> If you look in the right hand corner you can see the rough outline of the second character that I was planning to add to this sketch, which I never finished due to time constraints. Marked in very faintly with guidelines. Despite the lightness of my guidelines, I still found the need to erase into my sketch to remove the more scratchy guiding lines and ovals from the central character.

    <figcaption>There is a certain amount of expressiveness from the faces first drawings I started last November which I miss in my current, more cautious attempts at realism. I might revive that study with some modifications.

    <img alt="November 30th 2023" src="img/2023november/dailylines11,30,23.png">
    <figcaption>Today I was discussing online whether Chat GBT could code a game for a game jam project. I argued that it would be harder to get a Chat GBT game dev pipeline going than to actually code a game. Everyone I know is absolutely obsessed with AI however. And I am as well, I spent some time reading up on neural networks last week.
